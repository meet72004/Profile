            <p>
               I donâ€™t just write codeâ€”I craft digital experiences. As a passionate front-end developer and design enthusiast, I blend creativity with clean code to build interfaces that not only function, but *feel right*. This site is more than just my resumeâ€”it's a window into how I think, learn, and build.

        <p id="convert">Currency Converter</p>
        <p>One of the small but meaningful projects I built is a simple currency converter. It fetches live exchange rates using an API and updates flags dynamically based on the selected countries. While it's a basic tool, it was my first hands-on experience working with APIs, and it gave me a better understanding of how real-time data works in web applications. It also sparked my interest in exploring more interactive and useful features in future projects.</p>

    <div class="wa">
        <p>Another small project I worked on was a weather app that lets users search for a location and displays the current temperature and weather conditions using live data from an API. It was a simple project, but it helped me understand how to work with user input, asynchronous requests, and real-time data. It also gave me a better sense of how frontend and backend logic can work together in interactive applications.</p>
